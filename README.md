# SportsBuddy

SportsBuddy is a web app which great potential in the future with greater investments. However, initially aimed at University of Warwick students as we have know the culture and the environment there, it is also a campus therefore it offers a more flexible opportunity in testing out this great idea.

The basic idea of the app is that it connects students who are looking for practice partners in sports that require a partner or a group of individuals. For example, ambitious individuals in sports that require a partners, such as tennis, badminton and squash are sometimes left behind in practice time because of lack of partners. Furthermore, the app allows the user the flexibility of choosing partners with specific skill level at the given sport, therefore they can improve their skills by practicing with a better player.

The app is rich in the use of API’s, for example it is using pusher effectively to update the available events and session onto the users screen immediately, update the latest homepage events. Furthermore, we are using messageBird in notifying the user of updates to his/her event if someone joins it as an example.

The app offers the ability to be a true entrepreneurs working, as we have implemented Braintree in processing payments for tournaments, or events that require fees. Eventually we would advantage of these abilities in place when volume picks up.

In conclusion, the app has implemented a number of the sponsors API’s successfully with purpose, and the technology along with the potential of the idea has resulted in an outstanding achievement for a team that only met this weekend with varying experiences.
